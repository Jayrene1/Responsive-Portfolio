                        My name is Joshua, and I'm twenty-five years old. I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2015, and began working on my own as a private music teacher. Music runs in my family, and is a lifelong hobby. I started piano and guitar as early in life as possible, and I carry it on through recording and playing in cover bands or at churches.

                        I first became interested in the tech industry after learning the basics of programming from my brother. Another friend offered to teach me simple web development in exchange for guitar lessons, and from there I decided to pursue work in the web development field. My goals include learning a full stack in web development, and gaining as much relevant work experience as possible with large, highly structured companies.

                        My experience as a freelance guitar teacher taught me to run my work like a small business. I enjoyed structuring and improving my services to best meet my students' needs, and consistently relied on highly accessible technologies to provide that service. I believe that experience will make me a better developer as I learn to use my customer service skills and resourcefulness to meet employers' needs. I may also pursue freelance web development work in the future. Ultimately, I hope my skills in development will allow me to start my own business in the next 5-15 years.
